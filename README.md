`ysdl` (Youtube-Soundcloud Downloader) is a tool to search for--and download--songs from YouTube and SoundCloud using the command-line. It has 3 main components:

  1. Google searching (from [`googler`](https://github.com/jarun/googler))
  2. YouTube downloading (from [`youtube-dl`](https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl))
  3. SoundCloud downloading (from [`scdl`](https://github.com/flyingrub/scdl))

### Usage
Coming soon! `ysdl` is still being developed :)
